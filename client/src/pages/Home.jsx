  const description = "The collaboration between Honda and GM, alongside Toyotaâ€™s backing for hydrogen technology and retrofitting gas engines for hydrogen use, raises doubts about electric vehicle (EV) viability. Despite available conversion kits, reliability issues hinder gas-to-hydrogen adoption, contrasting EVs' more dependable performance. Toyota's hydrogen engine offers reliability but lacks fuel cell performance. Both face a common hurdle: the lack of hydrogen infrastructure and costly generators. EVs benefit from a robust charging network, surpassing hydrogen stations by far. Home hydrogen fueling is impractical due to high costs and complexity. Tesla's success highlights EV charging accessibility. Building a hydrogen infrastructure faces immense costs and challenges. Commercial hydrogen vehicles may work, but consumer adoption is doubtful. Battery technology advancements make hydrogen's switch unfeasible now. The future favors EVs due to infrastructure, cost, and technological advancements."
